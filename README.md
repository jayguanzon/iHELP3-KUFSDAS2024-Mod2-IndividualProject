# iHelp3

Create a landing page to share the iHelp3 community vision.

## Description

Right now I just want to start to organize my ideas to share with family and friends the type of community I would like to develop and take part of as one of my life's passion projects aligned with my higher purpose of helping to heal the world; our planet and our people.

I believe that we need to foster eachothers passions and align on purpose in a globally united way.

The platform and concept will be expressed along its development with those whom choose to co-create this platform in a coooperative fasion.
